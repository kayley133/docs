## Introduction

Keyboard is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to transform how you interact with AI clients like Claude via direct code execution and task automation. It provides a flexible and secure platform for connecting your internal applications to your AI client and executing complex tasks across various domains.

## What can Keyboard do?

Keyboard acts as a single, secure bridge between your AI client and the rest of your tools. With it, you can connect multiple applications, run every task inside your own infrastructure, automate end-to-end workflows, and trigger actions that adapt to the context of each requestâ€”all from one MCP server.

### Secure code execution

Whenever an AI-generated snippet runs through Keyboard, it does so in a sandboxed environment. Each run is isolated, logged, and governed by built-in safeguards that block malicious behavior before it can reach your production systems.

### Task automation

Connect all your apps via a single server. A single prompt can launch a multi-step sequence. Keyboard coordinates each call to external APIs, passes results from one step to the next, and allows for repetitive jobs to finish in the background.

## Core concepts

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP is the common language that lets an AI client request secure code execution. By implementing MCP, Keyboard lets the client spin up a workspace, send code, stream outputs, and release resources in a predictable, auditable flow.

### Execution tools

Behind the scenes, Keyboard supplies real-time WebSocket channels, a language-agnostic code runner, resource quotas to keep workloads under control, and token-scoped permissions that dictate exactly what each session can do.

## Security first

Every request is authenticated with scoped tokens, executed inside a tightly confined runtime, and checked against a comprehensive policy engine. If an operation touches sensitive data or systems, Keyboard pauses for explicit human approval before it proceeds.
