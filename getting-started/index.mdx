## Introduction

Keyboard is an open source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to transform how you interact with AI clients like Claude via direct code execution and task automation. It provides a flexible and secure platform for connecting your internal applications to your AI client and executing complex tasks across various domains.

## What can Keyboard do?

Keyboard acts as a single, secure bridge between your AI client and the rest of your tools. With it, you can connect multiple applications, run every task inside your own infrastructure, automate end-to-end workflows, and trigger actions that adapt to the context of each requestâ€”all from one MCP server.

### Secure code execution

Whenever an AI-generated snippet runs through Keyboard, it does so in a sandboxed environment. Each run is isolated, logged, and governed by built-in safeguards that block malicious behavior before it can reach your production systems.

### Task automation

Connect all your apps via a single server. A single prompt can launch a multi-step sequence. Keyboard coordinates each call to external APIs, passes results from one step to the next, and allows for repetitive jobs to finish in the background.

## Core concepts

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP is the common language that lets an AI client request secure code execution. By implementing MCP, Keyboard lets the client spin up a workspace, send code, stream outputs, and release resources in a predictable, auditable flow.

### Execution tools

Behind the scenes, Keyboard supplies real-time WebSocket channels, a language-agnostic code runner, resource quotas to keep workloads under control, and token-scoped permissions that dictate exactly what each session can do.

## Security first

Every request is authenticated with scoped tokens, executed inside a tightly confined runtime, and checked against a comprehensive policy engine. If an operation touches sensitive data or systems, Keyboard pauses for explicit human approval before it proceeds.
