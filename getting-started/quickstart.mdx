## Getting started

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:

  - Node.js version 18 or higher
  - Claude Desktop, with an account that can add integrations and MCP servers (other clients coming soon)
  - MacOS (for now\!) - This guide and the current release are for Mac users. We're working on support for other platformsâ€”stay tuned\!
</Info>

### Fork the Codespace repo

Fork this [repo](https://github.com/keyboard-dev/codespace-executor).

### Generate a GitHub PAT for the Codespace repo

If you are unfamiliar with how to create a GitHuB Personal Access Token (PAT) then refer to GitHub's docs [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) for how to quickly create one.

Generate a fine-grained GitHub PAT that only has access to the codespace-executor repo you forked and has the following codespaces permissions below (screenshots to follow):

- Codespaces: **Read and write**
- Codespaces lifecycle admin: **Read and write**
- Codespaces metadata: **Read-only**

Metadata: **Read-only** (this is preselected and mandatory on all fine-grained GitHub PATs)

You will need to copy and paste this PAT in the next step.

### Set up with Claude Desktop in Claude Desktop

Download the keyboard-mcp.dxt file found here: [dxt github release](https://github.com/keyboard-dev/keyboard-mcp/releases/latest)

Navigate to the Claude Desktop app Extensions page via the Claude settings page.

Drag and drop the downloaded keyboard-mcp.dxt file and click "Install".

Copy the GitHub PAT generated in the previous step into the Claude UI.

## Clone the Approver app

```
# Get access to both repos
git clone --recursive https://github.com/keyboard-dev/keyboard-local.git
cd keyboard-local

# Work on desktop electron app
cd apps/approver-client
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

## Add .env for the Desktop app

### Generate encryption keys

Run this script at the root of project to create your encryption keys. You will need to copy and paste them in the next step.

```
node generate-encryption-key.js
```

### Create the .env file

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following configuration. If in Claude Desktop you want to optionally encrypt messages sent from your local MCP server to your codespace execution server the `CODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` will be used to add an additional layer of encryption to the data in transit. You will also need to add an env variable to the codespace-executor called `KB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` that will be the same value as `CODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

```markdown
# Required
ENCRYPTION_KEY=RANDOM_ENCRYPTION_KEY

# Optional: Enable message encryption
#CODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=RANDOM_ENCRYPTION_KEY
```

In this project we also use [dotenvx](https://dotenvx.com/) to encrypt credentials at rest. Run the command below:

```
npx @dotenvx/dotenvx encrypt
npx @dotenvx/dotenvx ext gitignore
```

Now run the project.

```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# run the Electron App
npm run dev
```

Create an account and get started.

## Connect the Keyboard Desktop app to Claude

After you log in to the desktop app, find the "Settings" button. Once there, find your WebSocket key and copy it.

After you copy it, navigate back to Claude and add in the WebSocket Connection Key.

That's it\! Setup should be done.

## Troubleshooting

- Verify your `.env` file contains the correct info
- Ensure the MCP server is running and accessible
- If Claude is not loading trying quiting the Claude Desktop app and opening again
- On Mac if login on the electron app is not redirecting properly run:

```
/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user
```
