## Getting started

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:

  - Node.js version 18 or higher
  - Claude Desktop, with an account that can add integrations and MCP servers (other clients coming soon)
  - MacOS (for now\!) - This guide and the current release are for Mac users. We're working on support for other platforms—stay tuned\!
</Info>

### Fork the Codespace repo

Fork this [repo](https://github.com/keyboard-dev/codespace-executor).

### Generate a GitHub PAT for the Codespace repo

If you are unfamiliar with how to create a GitHuB Personal Access Token (PAT) then refer to GitHub's docs [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) for how to quickly create one.

Generate a fine-grained GitHub PAT that only has access to the codespace-executor repo you forked and has the following codespaces permissions below (screenshots to follow):

- Codespaces: **Read and write**
- Codespaces lifecycle admin: **Read and write**
- Codespaces metadata: **Read-only**

Metadata: **Read-only** (this is preselected and mandatory on all fine-grained GitHub PATs)

You will need to copy and paste this PAT in the next step.

### Set up in Claude Desktop

Download the keyboard-mcp.dxt file found here: [dxt github release](https://github.com/keyboard-dev/keyboard-mcp/releases/latest)

Navigate to the Claude Desktop app Extensions page via the Claude settings page.

![Img3 Pn](/images/img3.png)

Drag and drop the downloaded keyboard-mcp.dxt file and click "Install".

Copy the GitHub PAT generated in the previous step into the Claude UI.

### Use the Desktop App

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Option 1: Download and open the Desktop App">
    You can download and run the desktop app [here](https://github.com/keyboard-dev/approver-client/releases/download/v.0.0.1/keyboard-approver.App-darwin-arm64-1.0.0.zip).  Just unzip it and run.\
    \
    Create an account and get started.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Option 2: Git Clone the Approver app">
    ### 

    For running the code and desktop app yourself, copy the commands below.  This is useful if you want to contribute to project.

    ```
    # Get access to both repos
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/keyboard-dev/keyboard-local.git
    cd keyboard-local
    
    # Work on desktop electron app
    cd apps/approver-client
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    ```

    ## Add .env for the Approver app

    ### Generate encryption keys

    Run this script at the root of project to create your encryption keys. You will need to copy and paste them in the next step.

    ```
    node generate-encryption-key.js
    ```

    ### Create the .env file

    Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following configuration. If in Claude Desktop you want to optionally encrypt messages sent from your local MCP server to your codespace execution server the `CODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` will be used to add an additional layer of encryption to the data in transit. You will also need to add an env variable to the codespace-executor called `KB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` that will be the same value as `CODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

    ```markdown
    # Required
    ENCRYPTION_KEY=RANDOM_ENCRYPTION_KEY
    
    # Optional: Enable message encryption
    #CODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=RANDOM_ENCRYPTION_KEY
    ```

    In this project we also use [dotenvx](https://dotenvx.com/) to encrypt credentials at rest. Run the command below:

    ```
    npx @dotenvx/dotenvx encrypt
    npx @dotenvx/dotenvx ext gitignore
    ```

    Now run the project.

    ```
    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    
    # run the Electron App
    npm run dev
    ```

    Create an account and get started.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Connect the Keyboard Approver app to Claude

After you log in to the desktop app, find the "Settings" button. Once there, find your WebSocket key and copy it.

![Img4 Pn](/images/img4.png)

After you copy it, navigate back to Claude and add in the WebSocket Connection Key.

![Img5 Pn](/images/img5.png)

Now after you save make sure keyboard is enabled.

![Screenshot 2025-07-28 at 4.30.21 PM.png](/images/Screenshot2025-07-28at4.30.21PM.png)

That's it\! Setup should be done.

### Try your first prompt

Navigate back to the Claude chat in your Claude Desktop and try a prompt like this:

```markdown
Can you run hello world code with Keyboard?
```

![Screenshot 2025-07-28 at 4.31.46 PM.png](/images/Screenshot2025-07-28at4.31.46PM.png)

From here you should see Keyboard use tools to plan, create a codespace, connect to a websocket, and execute code that you will use the desktop app to approve.

## Troubleshooting

- Verify your `.env` file contains the correct info
- Ensure the MCP server is running and accessible
- If notifications are not showing up, go to notification settings on your Mac
- If Claude is not loading trying quiting the Claude Desktop app and opening again
- On Mac if login on the electron app is not redirecting properly run:

```
/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user
```
